# Introduction

Dinf is discriminator-based inference for population genetics.
It uses a neural network to discriminate between a target dataset
and a simulated dataset.
Inference is done by finding simulation parameters that produce
data closely matching the target dataset.
Dinf provides a [Python API](sec_api) for creating simulation models,
and a [CLI](sec_cli) for discriminator training and inference.
