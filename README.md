Dinf is discriminator-based inference for population genetics.
It uses a neural network to discriminate between a target dataset
and a simulated dataset.
Inference is done by finding simulation parameters that produce
data closely matching the target dataset.
Dinf provides a Python API for creating simulation models,
and a CLI for discriminator training and inference.

See the documentation for details.
